In today's class we started getting into the business of writing R code to make the graphs we want. We focused in particular on ideas about how graphs represent data, and in particular on the concept of a _mapping_ between some column of data in our table and a visual element---position on the x-axis, position on the y-axis, the property of color, and so on---that is representative of that data.
