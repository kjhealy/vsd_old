## About this Course

This class will do two things. First, it will teach you how to use modern, widely-used tools to create insightful, beautiful, reproducible visualizations of social science data. Second, you will also learn about the theory and practice of efforts to visualize sociological data, and society more generally. We will think about different ways of looking at social science data, about where data comes from in the first place, and about the implications of choosing to represent it in different ways.

By the end of the course you will

-   Understand the basic principles behind effective data visualization.
-   Have a practical sense for why some graphs and figures work well,
    while others may fail to inform or actively mislead.
-   Know how to create a wide range of plots in R using ggplot2.
-   Know how to refine plots for effective presentation.
-   Have an understanding of issues surrounding the collection and
    representation of data in the social sciences and beyond.

## Core Texts

I recommend (but do not require) you buy two books:

## Software

We will do all of our visualization work in this class using [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) to manage our code and projects. [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) is a freely-available programming language that is designed for statistical computing and widely used across the natural and social sciences, as well as in the rapidly-growing world of “data science” generally. [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is an integrated development environment, or IDE, for R, a kind of control center from which you can manage the engine-room of R itself. It is also freely available.

If you haven’t used these tools before, don’t worry. The course does not presuppose any familiarity with them. We will get up and running with them during the first week.

## Schedule

{{% topiclist %}}

The schedule is likely to change as we go. Links to readings, lecture notes, assignments, and other materials from class will be posted via the [Class](/class/) page.

## COVID-19 Considerations

At present, all classes are fully remote until January 18th. I will email you details about the Zoom meetings.

## Course policies

-   Attendance is required. I am a reasonable person; if you need to be absent please *let me know in advance* insofar as that is possible.
-   Do the assigned readings in advance of class.
-   Submit memos, problem sets, or other assigned work when they are due.

## Course Slack

During the first week you will receive an invitation to the [Slack workgroup]() for the course. This will be the most convenient way to share information with everyone, to distribute links to readings and code, and to contact me.

## Required Work and Grading

There are three kinds of [assignments](assignments/) for the course: memos, problem sets, and a final project.

-   **Reflection Memos** are 250 to 500 words long and response to the assigned reading. Problem sets are due on *Tuesdays* by the end of the day.  
-   **Problem Sets** let you practice your visualization skills. Problem sets are due on *Fridays* the week *after* they are given out.
-   A **Final Project** will allow you to develop a more substantial visualization or series of visualizations. I will suggest several possible datasets, or you can propose your own. The project is due on Friday, November 20th.

Reflection memos and problem sets may not be assigned every week.

There is no final exam for the class.

This semester, this course is graded on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) scale. For more information about S/U courses and the special policies that apply for the Fall 2020 semester, please [carefully read this overview](https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/unsatisfactory-satisfactory-grading-option) from the College of Arts & Sciences. You will obtain a Satisfactory grade in the course by (a) Attending and participating in class sessions, (b) Completing required weekly problem sets and exercises, and (c) Submitting the final project for the class.
